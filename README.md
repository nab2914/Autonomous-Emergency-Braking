# Autonomous Emergency Braking System  

An intelligent braking control system developed for Phase 2 of aBAJA SAEINDIA 2025, using sensor fusion and embedded control logic to detect obstacles and automatically apply brakes for enhanced vehicle safety.

## Overview  
This project implements an Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) algorithm designed for low-speed autonomous vehicles.  
It monitors distance and relative velocity using sensor data and triggers controlled braking when a potential collision is detected.

## Features  
- Real-time obstacle detection using RADAR, CAMERA and IMU sensors  
- Automatic brake actuation based on safe distance thresholds  
- PID-based deceleration control for smooth braking  
- Easily tunable parameters for different vehicle setups
